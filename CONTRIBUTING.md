# Contributing

I am absolutly supportive of contributions, but at the moment this project is
focused learning. As such; I'd like anyone who wants to contribute to limit
this to refactoring of existing code.

Any refactors must be well documented as to why they are improvements; how they
work and why this particular improvement is important.

I intend to leave a draft MR with a simple example of what this would look
like.

TL;DR

If your contribution isn't teaching me something I will be sad.  I'm doing this
for fun.  I've never implemented anything in `yacc` or `lex` before.

I want to understand more how to leverage low level syscalls to optimize file
reading/writing.  things like 'how to make `dd` as fast as possible'.  So,
someone else doing it for me will not teach me.  Me failing at it and getting a
good breakdown of how would.
